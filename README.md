# End-to-End-Heart-Disease-Classification

**Heart Disease Classification â€“ End-to-End ML Project**
- Developed a full machine learning pipeline to classify heart disease using clinical patient data.
- Performed EDA, feature engineering, and trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN).
- Achieved ~89% accuracy; analyzed model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.
- Interpreted key features (`sex`, `slope`, `cp`, `thal`) and proposed next steps for improvement.
- Documented the entire process with insights, reflection, and realistic evaluation metrics.
