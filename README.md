# End-to-End-Heart-Disease-Classification

**Heart Disease Classification | End-to-End ML Project**
- Built a complete machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease using clinical data.
- Conducted EDA, feature engineering, scaling, and model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN.
- Achieved ~89% accuracy; identified model limitations and proposed improvements (e.g., more data, advanced algorithms).
- Visualized results via confusion matrices and classification reports; documented key insights and next steps.
